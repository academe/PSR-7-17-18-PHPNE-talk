## Discovery

* Instead of DI, a library can discover a suitable implementation installed
* However, it needs to know the discovery service is installed
* Maybe good for late instantiation
* Probably more a convenience for legacy libraries
* It gets complicated fast

Notes:

* Omnipay is moving to discovery, but only because people expect it.
